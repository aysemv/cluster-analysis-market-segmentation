ABOUT THE DATA 

This data was gathered (1.0 marketing_segmentation.csv). 
Satisfaction is self-reported, people were asked to rate their shopping experience from 1 to 10, where 10 means extremely satisfied. Therefore satisfaction here is a discrete variable and takes integer values. 

Brand loyalty was measured through the number of purchases from that shop for a year and several other factors found to be significant. Brand loyalty variable range from -2.5 to 2.5 as the variable is already standardized.

Satisfaction and brand loyalty will be considered equally important.
